Data lineage is a key component of provenance that helps scientists  track and query
relationships between input and output data.  While current systems readily
support lineage relationships at the file or data array level, finer-grained
support at an array-cell level is impractical due to the lack of support
for user defined operators and the high runtime and storage overhead to store
such lineage.


We interviewed scientists in several domains to identify a set of common
semantics that can be leveraged to efficiently store fine-grained lineage.  We
use the insights to define lineage representations that efficiently capture
common locality properties in the lineage data, and a set of APIs so operator
developers can easily export lineage information from user defined operators.
Finally, we introduce two benchmarks derived from astronomy and genomics, and
show that our techniques can reduce lineage query costs by up to 10$\times$
while incuring substantially less impact on workflow runtime and storage.


%Provenance refers to the process of determining which inputs contributed
%to a particular output in a database query or scientific workflow.
%It is important in a number of debugging and exploratory development
%settings, and has been identified as a key requirement of next generation
%data management systems, particularly those focused on scientific use-cases
%where workflows can be very complex.
%
%In this paper, we present \sys{}, a provenance system for the SciDB
%scientific database system.  \sys{} builds on prior provenance systems
%by exploiting the semantics of scientific operations to efficiently
%encode provenance information, and provides an API for developers to
%record the provenance of their user-defined operators. \sys{} uses an
%optimization framework to select from several different methods of
%storing provenance, while respecting user-specified space and time
%constraints on the cost of recording provenance.  Two
%benchmarks derived from astronomy and genetics show that these
%optimizations make \sys{} up to 10$\times$ faster at executing a
%provenance query workload than a system that records fine-grained provenance
%between individual data items, while having substantially less impact
%on workflow runtime and requiring much less storage.
